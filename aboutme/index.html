   <h2>Zachary Sharr</h2>
   <p>Hello, my name is Zachary Sharr. I am from Arizona and still live there today. I have been married for almost 7 Years to my beautiful wife Jena.
    We have a 3 year old daughter named Evie. She is incredibly outspoken with a bold personality and keeps us on our toes but love every second of it.
    I am technically a junior credit wise but have been slowly working on my Business managment degree on the side. I work for a company called Sports 
    Venture. We sell licensed sports merchendise. I am the Digital Marketing Manager for the company. I also served a fulltime mission many years ago 
    in India. Nice to meet y'all!
